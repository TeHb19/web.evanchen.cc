This is a place where I post notes that I typed
when leading my 18.02 recitation at Mass Tech in fall 2024.
My recitation is MW9 in 2-135, but students in other sections
should feel free to use these notes however you find them useful to you.

For my students: here's the [attendance form](https://forms.gle/mmbC8q7jwiw9MBgw5).

## Evan's 18.02 LAMV book (work-in-progress)

I'm working on a set of replacement lecture notes for 18.02 that will be
readable not only for this semester but also useful in the future
(e.g. students who wish to [test out of 18.02](https://math.mit.edu/academics/undergrad/first/advanced.php)).

## Quick temporary answer keys for recitations

These are really hastily cobbled together and might contain mistakes.
It's mostly useful for checking your work;
there will be a proper solutions file prepared by the TA's later on Canvas.
This is just a stopgap in the meantime since the official solutions
file usually takes an extra day or two to go online.
