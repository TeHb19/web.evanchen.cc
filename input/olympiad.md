---

These are some handouts I've written over the years.
The [Math](https://blog.evanchen.cc/category/mathematics/) and
[Problem-Solving](https://blog.evanchen.cc/category/problem-solving/) sections
of my personal blog might also be of interest.
See also [Recommendations](recommend.html) for other authors I like,
and my [geometry book](geombook.html) for a
comprehensive textbook in Euclidean geometry.
See also [Problems](problems.html) for contest papers.

**LaTeX notes**:
I provided the LaTeX source for most of these files as an example here.
But note to compile these documents in LaTeX, you will need
[my personal style file evan.sty][evan.sty].
Because this style file evolves over time,
your output might look a little different from the PDF's attached here.
