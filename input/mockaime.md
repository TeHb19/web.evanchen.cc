The **OTIS Mock AIME** is an annual 3-hour exam consisting of 15 problems
whose answers are integers between $0$ and $999$.
As the name suggests, it is yet another unofficial paper intended to emulate the
[American Invitational Mathematics Exam][aime].

The defining characteristic of the OTIS Mock AIME is that all the problems
are composed by students from the [OTIS program](otis.html).
That is, Evan runs this annual exam as a way to give his students
a chance to try their hand at problem composition.

## {{ hl("current", "Current edition") }}

The OTIS Mock AIME 2025 is out! There are two versions this year, I and II.
You can do either or both!
The submission link is in the PDF file itself
(note the links are different for the two versions).

- [Download OTIS 2025 Mock AIME I](/exams/OTIS-Mock-AIME-2025-I.pdf)
- [Download OTIS 2025 Mock AIME II](/exams/OTIS-Mock-AIME-2025-II.pdf)

Note that the two tests are quite different from each other:

1. The _OTIS Mock AIME I_ is going to be tough.
   It will definitely be harder than the actual AIME, by perhaps 2 to 4 problems.
   But more tangibly, it will also have _significant artistic license_.[^vision]
   Problems will freely assume IMO-style background throughout the test,
   and intentionally stretch the boundary of what constitutes an "AIME problem".

2. The _OTIS Mock AIME II_ is meant to be more practically useful.
   It will adhere more closely to the difficulty and style of past official AIME's.
   There will inevitably still be some more IMO-flavored problems,
   but they'll appear later in the ordering.

Logistics:

- The problems file will provide a link to submit answers.
  No registration or pre-commitment is required.

- If you'd like to submit for statistics/bragging, the deadline is
  **Monday, January 20, 2025 at 11:59pm Pacific time** (for both tests).
  Please avoid public spoilers for the problems before that date.

- Anyone will be able to download the exam and attempt the problems,
  and submit their answers for scoring.
  We may recognize high scores for bragging rights but don't otherwise offer prizes.

[^vision]: I think of what the AIME could be, a vision of the one I see...

- You can download the [2024 problems now](/exams/OTIS-Mock-AIME-2024.pdf).

- There's a [forum thread on AoPS](https://aops.com/community/p29466910)
  for discussion of the problems and so on.

- Solutions and statistics will be posted no later than January 20, 2024.
  If you've already submitted (or won't submit for scoring)
  and would like hints or solutions on problems before then, though,
  feel free to email Evan for a nudge.

- For the 2024 exam, Evan will stream a review session
  (presenting the solutions to all the problems)
  on [twitch.tv/vEnhance](https://twitch.tv/vEnhance)
  starting at 8pm Eastern time on Friday, January 19, 2024.
  The video recording will be on YouTube later.

## {{ hl("format", "Format") }}

Like the AIME, there are 15 problems to solve in 3 continuous hours
and all answers are integers ranging from 000 to 999, inclusive.

Problem statements follow [ARML 2014 conventions][arml],
so for example $\left\lfloor x \right\rfloor$ is the floor of $x$.
You may refer to these conventions during the exam.

For scored submissions, no aids other than writing utensils and erasers,
scratch paper, graph paper, ruler, compass, protractor are permitted.
In particular, books, notes, calculators, cell phones, computers, abacuses,
ChatGPT, magic crystal balls, etc., are all prohibited.
